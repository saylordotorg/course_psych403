**Unit 4: Emotion** <span id="4"></span> 
*There are a number of different theories that aim to explain why and
how we have emotions because it is impossible to prove whether they are
right and wrong.  Even something as seemingly straightforward as the
definition of an emotion is a source of disagreement.  Emotion is a
particularly interesting topic because of its intensely personal nature;
what makes one person mad will not necessarily make another person mad. 
That is, emotions are highly subjective—both on a personal level and in
terms of cultural norms as well.  Certain emotions are more likely to be
felt, or expressed, in certain cultures as a result of set of stimuli. 
This leads us to the question of whether an individual’s culture plays a
role in determining a person’s emotional response.  There are two
theoretical models that aim to answer this question: one argues that
emotions are culture-specific and the other claims that there are
universal emotions.  You will learn about them both here, recognizing
that the debate as to which is correct continues to this day.*
