**Unit 5: Motivation and Behavior** <span id="5"></span> 
*Human motivation has long been considered the result of evolutionary
processes.  In other words, we tend to be motivated by things that help
us survive (food, sex, water) and things that are associated with these
essentials (money that can be used to buy food, and so on).  However,
motivation is not quite so simple.  We now have a number of theories
that attempt to accurately describe why certain states may motivate some
people but not others.  This idea can be extrapolated at the level of
culture and society as well.  For example, the state of hunger might
cause us to be highly motivated by food.  However, hunger itself may be
under strict cultural control.  In fact, most aspects of our eating
habits are linked in some way to culture.  As such, motivators are also,
in some way, linked to our culture.  This unit touches on the universal
theories of motivation and examines how certain approaches to culture
can better determine what will be a motivating factor versus what will
not.*
