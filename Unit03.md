**Unit 3: Intelligence** <span id="3"></span> 
*Intelligence is a difficult concept to define, even within one
culture.  In the West, the concept of “intelligence” started out as a
general measure of knowledge and understanding, but it has come to mean
everything from emotional acuity to academic potential and everything in
between.  It has come to be thought of as essential to success. 
However, this idea may not be shared by, or may be construed in a
different manner within, other cultures.  The West has even developed
tests (like IQ tests) that aim at measuring one’s intelligence. 
However, because these tests are based on the Western idea of
intelligence, they may fail to accurately measure intelligence in
another culture. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will review the different ways intelligence has been
defined, both as part of Western psychology and across different
cultures.  We will also ask how, by changing how we understand
intelligence, we must change how we measure and quantify it.  *
