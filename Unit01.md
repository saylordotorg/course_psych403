**Unit 1: The History and Theories of Cultural Psychology** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Our first unit explores the history and prevailing theories of cultural
psychology.  This unit serves as an introduction to the way cultural
psychology has developed as a topic of study.  As mentioned in the
course introduction, the history of cultural psychology is somewhat
limited, partly because many major psychological findings have
traditionally been considered true for all individuals, regardless of
cultural background.  In this unit, we review some of the ways this
belief has been shown to be false.  We also investigate several current
theories pertaining to how psychology can be understood in cultural
terms.  While these theories are not all-encompassing, they make
important contributions to the field.  As such, it will be important to
keep these theories in mind as we progress through the different
units.  *
