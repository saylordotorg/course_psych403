**Unit 6: Human Development** <span id="6"></span> 
*Human development was once considered a completely universal process
for all humans.  Psychologists like Erikson and Piaget defined the
step-by-step stages that they believed all individuals go through as
they develop.  While these theories remain important to the field of
psychology, they take the issue of environmental interaction too
lightly.  While most biological and physical growth is somewhat
universal, many aspects of how we develop are more accurately explained
by the culture and society in which we develop.  Consider, for example,
the fact that these theories are based on the idea of self-sufficiency
(or individualism), which is highly regarded in our culture.  However,
many cultures are less individualistic and may think that individualism
is a sign of poor (rather than satisfactory or average) development. 
These observations do not necessarily discredit the stage theories of
Erikson and Piaget, but they do raise questions about their
applicability to all cultures.  Further, while many psychologists would
argue that development is indeed stage-based, there are some examples
that seem to suggest otherwise.*
