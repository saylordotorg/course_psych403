**Unit 7: Psychological Disorders** <span id="7"></span> 
*This final unit examines the impact that specific cultures have on
psychological disorders.  There are a number of ways in which
psychological disorders, their diagnoses, and their treatment are
culture specific.  Our culture sees psychological disorders as a
legitimate health concern.  In other cultures, however, mental health is
not viewed in the same way.  Culture-specific beliefs about religious
possession or evil spirits remain common.  Meanwhile, some cultures
believe that shamans, medicine men, and other spiritual guides have
meaningful prophetic visions.  While no one is discounting these
visions, it is interesting to note that our culture might view these
visions as a symptom of schizophrenia, a powerful mental disorder.  In
addition, psychological disorders like depression and anorexia are
fairly uncommon elsewhere, but they are prevalent in our culture.*  
  
 *Even cultures that accept psychological disorders may treat those
disorders in different ways.  In our culture, therapy and
pharmacological intervention are most common, but in other cultures,
religious direction or some other form of intervention may be sought. 
These are just a few examples of how psychological disorders are indeed
a cultural construct.  It is important to note that this concept in no
way reduces the gravity of psychological disorders in our culture;
disorders and their effects are quite serious and should be treated as
such.*
