**Unit 2: Cognition** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit focuses on how culture influences cognition (our thought
processes).  While many of the processes of cognition are thought to be
the same for all humans, there is some evidence that our experience with
the environment can shape some of the ways we use cognition.  Each
culture creates a certain set of expectations that we use to interpret
and understand the stimuli with which we constantly deal.  Think, for
example, about television.  We understand that the people on television
are somewhere else and are broadcasted to our TV because we live in a
culture in which most individuals use TV in their daily lives.  However,
if your culture had never seen or used a TV before, you might not know
what to think when seeing someone on a television.  While this example
is somewhat simplistic, it relays one of the major messages of this
unit: Our cognitive processes are, in fact, dependent on our cultural
environment.  This unit also investigates the ways in which cognitive
processes (like the perception of time and consciousness) can be
affected by culture.*
